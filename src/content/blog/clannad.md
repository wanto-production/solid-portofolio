Clannad isn’t just an anime — it’s an emotional experience.

When I first started watching it, I thought I was prepared. I had seen emotional anime before. I’ve cried at a few scenes in _Your Lie in April_ and _Anohana_. But Clannad… Clannad was different. It wasn’t just one emotional hit. It was wave after wave of heartbreak, warmth, and bittersweet beauty.

## The First Tear

The first time I cried was during Fuuko’s arc. I didn’t expect such an early story to hit so hard, but the bittersweet way her presence lingered in people’s hearts — even when they’d forgotten her — was hauntingly beautiful.

## The Second Blow

The second time was during Nagisa’s graduation scene. The buildup of all her struggles, her kindness, and how hard she worked to finally reach that moment — it felt like watching a real friend triumph after endless hardship.

## Third: The Family Hits Home

Tomoya’s journey as a father hit me on a personal level. The quiet, everyday moments — his exhaustion, his regrets, and eventually his growth — were portrayed with such realism. It reminded me of people I know. And yes, I cried again.

## Fourth: The Breaking Point

I don’t even need to explain this one. _You know_ which scene. If you’ve seen _After Story_, you know the exact moment when the world just… stops. I couldn’t even breathe. I paused the episode and just sat in silence.

## Fifth: The Light in the Darkness

Clannad doesn't just break you — it _heals_ you too. The final arc brought tears of hope. It made me reflect on loss, time, and second chances. I didn't cry because I was sad — I cried because I was grateful.

## Why Clannad Stays With Me

Clannad isn’t flashy. It’s not about action or wild plot twists. It’s about **connection**, **growth**, and **life** itself. It felt like growing up — like reliving love, grief, and healing in a quiet, soft-lit world.

Even now, the music triggers memories. The sound of "Dango Daikazoku" is enough to make my throat tighten.

So yes — _Clannad made me cry five times_.

And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
