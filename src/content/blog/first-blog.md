When I was a kid, I used to think that people who watched anime were just lazy, thoughtless, cringy, and had all sorts of negative stigmas attached to them.

But when I entered middle school, I had a friend who used to be a troublemaker but had become kind and friendly. He liked watching harem or romance anime. I used to think romance anime were cringe and boring—especially since they’re just 2D.

But everything changed when I watched the anime **"Oregairu"**. It had a slightly sad and painful ending, an amazing story, and incredible character development. I didn’t even realize how bad the animation in Season 1 was because I was so focused on the character growth.

From this anime, I learned a lot about life, critical thinking, and maybe got a little possessed by the idea of becoming the main character (hehe).

## My Rating for Oregairu

- **Romance:** 7/10
- **Comedy:** 6/10
- **Philosophy:** 100/10 (mind-blowing)

Overall, this anime is pretty good with its 3 seasons.  
_By the way, I still haven’t moved on from it._
