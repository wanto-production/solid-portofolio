My journey began with an old, slow laptop...

I first touched programming using **Scratch**, and eventually something clicked.

It wasn't about the complexity — it was the feeling of creating something out of nothing. A sprite moved across the screen because I told it to. I had **power**. From that moment, I knew I was hooked.

## Leveling Up: From Blocks to Code

After a while, Scratch started to feel like training wheels. I wanted to build things beyond drag-and-drop — real websites, maybe even games.

So I took a bold step and jumped into **HTML & CSS**. My first website? A horrendous neon-colored mess with Comic Sans, of course. But it was **mine**. I built it, and that felt incredible.

Then I found **JavaScript**. It was like unlocking the next tier — and then came the real challenge: frameworks.

## Discovering Nuxt & SvelteKit

I started experimenting with **Vue** and quickly found **Nuxt**. Suddenly, routing and SEO weren’t so scary anymore. Nuxt made the entire flow feel clean and productive. That led me to building real-world apps, from blogs to dashboards.

But curiosity got the better of me, and I explored **SvelteKit**. That minimalism, that speed — it felt magical. I realized it wasn’t just about tools anymore; it was about using the **right tool for the right job**.

## Terminal Life & NeoVim Obsession

Somewhere along the way, I discovered **NeoVim**. It was confusing at first, but once I had it configured with LSP, auto-completion, treesitter, and Tmux integration — I didn’t want to leave the terminal again.

I learned to embrace `:wq`, `:split`, and `hjkl`. My config became my **personal dojo**. I stopped copying tutorials and started building **projects that solved my own problems**.

## Lessons from the Journey

- **Start small**. Scratch taught me logic in the most visual way possible.
- **Break stuff**. Every broken site taught me something new.
- **Stay curious**. The tech world evolves fast — keep exploring.
- **Community matters**. Forums, Discords, GitHub issues — I wasn't alone.

## What's Next?

I’m still learning. Maybe Rust, maybe AI, maybe building tools for others like me just starting out with a dusty laptop and a dream.

If you're reading this and just starting out: **keep going**. It’s okay to feel lost — every fullstack dev was a confused beginner once.
