I love Neovim.

Not just like a tool I use every day — but as a deeply **personal choice** in how I write code, how I think, and how I express myself as a developer. It gives me something that few editors can: **freedom**. Real, raw, no-hand-holding freedom.

### 🛠 The Power of Customization

With Neovim, every keypress can be yours. You define your workflow, not the editor. Want to navigate between files with just `hjkl`? Want a full LSP setup with beautiful autocompletion and diagnostics — but only for the languages _you_ use? Done. You can build your dream editor from the ground up, piece by piece.

For someone who enjoys understanding their tools, this level of control is addictive. Every tweak, every plugin you choose, every line in your `init.lua` — it’s like forging your own lightsaber.

### 💥 But Then There's TSX, JSX, and Astro

As much as I love Neovim, modern frontend development — especially with `tsx`, `jsx`, and `astro` — has made things… messy.

- **TSX & JSX syntax highlighting** sometimes breaks or lags.
- **Autocompletion** isn't always reliable when working across HTML and JavaScript in the same file.
- **Astro files** confuse some plugins entirely — especially treesitter or LSP clients that don’t know what to do with the hybrid syntax.

I’ve spent hours (okay, days) tweaking Treesitter configs, LSP settings, and testing plugins just to get a smooth experience in these filetypes.

And yet, I still stick with it.

### 🤝 Love Isn’t Always Easy

Yes, Neovim makes me work harder. But it also **makes me better**. It pushes me to learn how my tools work, not just use them blindly.

Even when it's frustrating, I know that with enough time and the right configuration, I can make it work _my_ way. And that’s something I wouldn’t trade for anything.

So here's to Neovim — the editor that gives me headaches, makes me google weird plugin issues at 2am, and still manages to be the most empowering tool I’ve ever used.
